#slide[
  == Identify the target trial
  What would be the ideal *randomized experiment* to answer the question?
  #cite(<hernan2016using>)

]

#slide[
  == PICO framework

  - Population : Who are we interested in?
  - Intervention : What treatment/intervention do we study?
  - Comparison : What are we comparing it to?
  - Outcome : What are we interested in?

#new-section-slide("How to ask a sound causal question")

#slide[
  == What is a #alert[why question] ?

- Economics: How does supply and demand (causally) depend on price?

- Policy: Are job training programmes actually effective?

- Epidemiology: How does this threatment affect the patient's health? 

- Public health : Is this prevention campaign effective?

- Psychology: What is the effect of family structure on childrenâ€™s outcome?

- Sociology: What is the effect of social media on political opinions?
]

#slide[
  == This is different from a #alert[predictive question]

  - What will be the weather tomorrow?
  - What will be the outcome of the next election?
  - How many people will get infected by flue next season?
  - What is the cardio-vacular risk of this patient?
  - How much will the price of a stock be tomorrow?
]

#slide[
  == Why is #alert[prediction different from causation]?


  - Prediction assumes stability between train and test data
  #uncover(2)[- Causal inference search the effect of an intervention]
]


#slide[
  == How to ask a sound causal question

  - Define the population of interest
  - Define the intervention
  - Define the outcome
  - Define the counterfactual
  - Define the causal effect

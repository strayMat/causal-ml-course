#slide[
  == What is a #alert[why question] ?

- Economics: How does supply and demand (causally) depend on price?

- Policy: Are job training programmes actually effective?

- Epidemiology: How does this threatment affect the patient's health? 

- Public health : Is this prevention campaign effective?

- Psychology: What is the effect of family structure on childrenâ€™s outcome?

- Sociology: What is the effect of social media on political opinions?

#slide[
  == This is different from a #alert[predictive question]

  - What will be the weather tomorrow?
  - What will be the outcome of the next election?
  - How many people will get infected by flue next season?
  - What is the cardio-vacular risk of this patient?
  - How much will the price of a stock be tomorrow?
]

#slide[
  == Why is #alert[prediction different from causation]?


  - Prediction (most part of Machine Learning) focus on understanding what usually happens in a given situation.
  
  #uncover(2)[It assumes iid between train and test data.]

  #uncover(3)[
  
  - Causal inference (most part of economists) focus on what would happen if we changed the system ie. under intervention.
  
  It models the covariate shift between treated and control units.

//TODO: insert images of covariate shifts to illustrate.

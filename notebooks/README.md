# JupyTEXT Plugin (local users)

We use the [JupyTEXT](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) plugin to version the notebooks.

Command to launch Jupyter correctly configured : `make jupyter-notebook`

You can then open either the `.ipynb` or paired `.py` files.

### Why this plugin?

JupyTEXT allows saving the content of notebooks, without their outputs, in a Python file (extension `.py`).
These files can be versioned without risk.

Finally, these files can be easily re-executed if they produce results,
for example `python 001-decouverte_donn√©es.py`.

To version a notebook *with* its outputs, for example if it serves as a report, prefer an export to `pdf` or `html`.

### Tracking in git
The notebook folder is configured to ignore by default all files except the `.py` files generated by jupytext.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, one of the two files `.ipynb` and `.py` is modified outside of Jupyter + JupyTEXT, via git or direct editing.

*Problem*: The files are then no longer compatible, which creates an error upon opening.

*Solution*: Delete (or move elsewhere for safety) one of the two files.

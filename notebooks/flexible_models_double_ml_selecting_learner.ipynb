    "# Choice of learners for double machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks contains some practical recommendations to choose the right learner and evaluate different learners for the corresponding nuisance components. It is an extension of the [DoubleML package example on learner selection](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/examples/py_double_ml_learner.html), adding an example with non-linear data. It is a small introduction to\n",
    "Double-Machine Learning that you will cover more in depth in the following course.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will work with a simulated linear model for the data generating process and compare different learners for the nuisance components. In the second part, we will work with a non-linear data generating process and compare different learners for the nuisance components.\n",

    "## Linear Partial Linear Regression Model (PML)\n",
    "Let $D$ the treatment, $Y$ the outcome, $X$ the confounders, $\\theta$ the targeted causal effect (here supposed to be constent).\n",

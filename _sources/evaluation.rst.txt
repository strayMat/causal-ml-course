==========
Evaluation 
==========

The evaluation is based on a small project on real data making use of some important concepts seen in course. Run through the different steps of causal or predictive inference with machine learning on a dataset of your choice (see below for some propositions of dataset).

You will hand over a notebook detailing both the formalization of your problem, the chosen methods to address the question of interest, and the results of your analysis. The notebook should be clear and well-structured, with a good balance between text and code. You can use either R or python. For causal inference, you can use the `Double ML package <https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/>`__.

Enrollment
----------

Group: From 2 to 4 students

----------------------------
Details plan of the analysis 
----------------------------

Important concepts that should appear are shown in parentheses.

- PICO formulation
- Data exploration (EDA)
- Identification (Causal Graph)
- Choice of the covariate to include
- Estimation with a statistical model: appropriate causal estimator and regressor 
- Parameter/model selection
- Conclusion and discussion 

If time allows, you are encouraged to explore the following. This is not necessary to obtain the maximum note. 

- Discussion on the assumptions chosen for identification of the effect
- sensitivity analysis : placebo check, different models, different covariate sets
- heterogeneous treatment effects

---------
Datasets 
---------

Here are some datasets that you can use for the project. You can also use your own dataset but in this case, please add a short justification for the interest of the dataset.

Criteria for notations 
----------------------

- 30 %: General form of the notebook, clarity of the text, and the structure of the notebook.

- 50 %: Multiple concepts seen during the course are present and appropriately used. Are the results correctly interpreted?

- 15 %: Presence and intelligibility of figures (during the exploration and presenting the results).

- 15 %: Do the analysis and its conclusion make sense? Is it convincing?

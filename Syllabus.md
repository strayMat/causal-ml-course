## Course syllabus

## Content 

Four sessions of three hours presenting important concepts and methods on modern causal inference. For step of the causal inference workflow, illustrate with well known examples from the econometric literature and run some codes for student to get some intuition.

Code samples : 

- Running example ? 

## Evaluation 

- Articles implementation/read and present
- Mini-project (Choosing a running example among different data-sets/problems).

## Session 1

- Intro to causal inference : Intersection of different fields : stats, econometrics/epidemiology,  machine learning

- Different concepts, similar ideas : 

- Asking a sound causal question : a scientific matter

- Notations

- Causal graph, front-door criteria and valid adjustment sets.
 
- Coding session : Valid and unvalid adjustment sets, with simple linear models. Effects on  

## Session 2

- ATE

- Model-based or outcome based identification

- Identification proofs 


## Session 3

- Looking for HTE, 

- DML : theoretical advantages for high-dimensional data

- Targeted learning : only mention

## Session 4

- Sensitivity analysis 

- Optimal policy?



## Session 5 (Advanced topics) 

- Going AI : feature engineering and causal inference ?  

- IV 

- DID

- Synthetic controls ?
